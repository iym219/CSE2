//previously we learned about the declaring variables and the main method for the entire code
//We will see and example of separating the code in several methods to make it simpler
// public static void computespeed(){- an example of declaring a method; still need to add void 
// then with the brackets and coding below the method
// then you need to include "public static void main(String() args){
    // to include the previous method, it is name_below();"
// also you can include the method with an argument such as"public static void addInterest(float interstate)
    //below in this method it is //float Interstae = .05f
//then in the main String, you will have 

//Also you can place commands outside of the methods so that command is set for all method
    //technically any coding within the bracket of a certain method, it will only pertain to that method
//REMEMBER TO INCLUDE "STATIC"
//void= no type
